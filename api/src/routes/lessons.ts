/**
 * Generate the lesson prompt for a given unit
 */
const getLessonPrompt = (unit: Unit): string => {
  return `You are an expert STEM educator and curriculum designer.

Task:
Generate **detailed lessons** for each section of a unit. Each lesson should be **long enough to fully explain the concept**, include **intuitive explanations, examples, and real-world applications**, and describe any **diagrams** verbally. **Formulas and equations** should be **embedded naturally in explanations** using **LaTeX**, no separate math section. Avoid overly short one-line explanations. Each lesson should be standalone so a student reading it understands the concept completely.

Input JSON:

${JSON.stringify({ unit })}

Output JSON:
{
  "unitTitle": "<unitTitle>",
  "unitDescription": "<unitDescription>",
  "lessons": [
    {
      "sectionId": "<sectionId>",
      "title": "<title>",
      "lessonContent": {
        "introduction": "<brief introduction, motivation for the topic>",
        "coreConcepts": [
          {
            "conceptTitle": "<concept name>",
            "explanation": "<detailed explanation covering the concept, embedding LaTeX for math naturally>",
            "example": "<worked example or real-world application>",
            "diagramDescription": "<description of diagram, if any>"
          },
          ...
        ],
        "summary": ["<key takeaways in bullet points>"],
        "quickCheckQuestions": [
          {"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"},
          ...
        ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Instructions:
- Generate a **separate JSON object for each section**, and combine them in a **JSON array**.
- Cover **all learning goals** listed for each section.
- Include multiple **core concepts** if the topic has subtopics.
- Provide **detailed explanations** (200–500 words per section).
- Use **LaTeX for all formulas**, embedded naturally in explanations.
- Include **real-world applications and examples** wherever possible.
- Describe **diagrams verbally** to aid understanding.
- List **common mistakes and misconceptions**.
- Provide **quick-check questions** with answers.
- Output strictly as JSON. Do **not** add any text outside the JSON array.


CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- Output MUST be valid strict JSON parsable by JSON.parse()
- Escape ALL backslashes in LaTeX using double backslashes (\\\\)
- Example: use "\\\\Delta x", "\\\\frac{a}{b}", "\\\\text{m/s}"
- Do NOT output raw LaTeX with single backslashes
- Do NOT include markdown code fences


Here is an example input and output for your reference:

Instructions:
- Create one section for each input section in the unit
- Each section MUST have all 4 microsection types: article, video, quiz, practice
- Article microsection: Include 2-4 core concepts with detailed explanations (200-400 words each)
- Video microsection: Provide placeholder with relevant title and description
- Quiz microsection: Include 3-5 questions (mix of multiple-choice and true-false)
- Practice microsection: Include 2-4 harder problems with detailed explanations
- Use LaTeX for all formulas (double-escaped: \\\\frac{a}{b})
- Generate unique IDs for each element (e.g., "section-1", "1-1-article", "q1-1-1")
- Slugify section IDs (e.g., "what-is-physics", "scalars-and-vectors")
- Cover ALL learning goals from the input
- Make quiz questions test understanding, practice questions test application

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- Output MUST be valid strict JSON parsable by JSON.parse()
- Escape ALL backslashes in LaTeX using double backslashes (\\\\)
- Example: use "\\\\Delta x", "\\\\frac{a}{b}", "\\\\text{m/s}"
- Do NOT output raw LaTeX with single backslashes
- Do NOT include markdown code fences`;
