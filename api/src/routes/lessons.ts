/*
You are an expert STEM educator and curriculum designer.

Task:
Generate **detailed lessons** for each section of a unit. Each lesson should be **long enough to fully explain the concept**, include **intuitive explanations, examples, and real-world applications**, and describe any **diagrams** verbally. **Formulas and equations** should be **embedded naturally in explanations** using **LaTeX**, no separate math section. Avoid overly short one-line explanations. Each lesson should be standalone so a student reading it understands the concept completely.

Input JSON:
{
  "unitTitle": "<unitTitle>",
  "unitDescription": "<unitDescription>",
  "sections": [
    {
      "sectionId": "<sectionId>",
      "title": "<title>",
      "description": "<description>",
      "learningGoals": ["<learningGoal1>", "<learningGoal2>", "..."]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Output JSON:
{
  "unitTitle": "<unitTitle>",
  "unitDescription": "<unitDescription>",
  "lessons": [
    {
      "sectionId": "<sectionId>",
      "title": "<title>",
      "lessonContent": {
        "introduction": "<brief introduction, motivation for the topic>",
        "coreConcepts": [
          {
            "conceptTitle": "<concept name>",
            "explanation": "<detailed explanation covering the concept, embedding LaTeX for math naturally>",
            "example": "<worked example or real-world application>",
            "diagramDescription": "<description of diagram, if any>"
          },
          ...
        ],
        "summary": ["<key takeaways in bullet points>"],
        "quickCheckQuestions": [
          {"question": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"},
          ...
        ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Instructions:
- Generate a **separate JSON object for each section**, and combine them in a **JSON array**.
- Cover **all learning goals** listed for each section.
- Include multiple **core concepts** if the topic has subtopics.
- Provide **detailed explanations** (200–500 words per section).
- Use **LaTeX for all formulas**, embedded naturally in explanations.
- Include **real-world applications and examples** wherever possible.
- Describe **diagrams verbally** to aid understanding.
- List **common mistakes and misconceptions**.
- Provide **quick-check questions** with answers.
- Output strictly as JSON. Do **not** add any text outside the JSON array.

      "lessonContent": {
        "introduction": "In this lesson, you will learn about scalar and vector quantities, which are the foundation for describing motion in physics. Understanding these concepts is crucial because they allow us to analyze and predict how objects move in one dimension.",

            "conceptTitle": "Scalars",
            "explanation": "Scalars are quantities that are described completely by a magnitude alone. Common examples include distance, speed, mass, and temperature. For instance, if a car travels 50 meters, the distance is a scalar because only the magnitude matters, not the direction.",
            "example": "A runner covers 100 meters in 12 seconds. The speed of the runner is a scalar quantity: speed = distance/time = 100/12 ≈ 8.33 m/s.",

          },

            "explanation": "Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Examples include displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Displacement is a vector, represented as \\( \\vec{d} \\), which points from the initial to the final position. Vector addition follows the triangle or parallelogram law. For motion in one dimension, vectors can be added algebraically, considering their signs for direction.",
            "example": "If a car moves 30 meters east and then 20 meters west, the displacement is \\( \\vec{d} = 30 - 20 = 10 \\) meters east.",

          },
          {
            "conceptTitle": "Average Speed and Velocity",
            "explanation": "Average speed is a scalar given by total distance divided by total time: \\( v_{avg} = \\frac{d_{total}}{t_{total}} \\). Average velocity is a vector given by total displacement over total time: \\( \\vec{v}_{avg} = \\frac{\\vec{d}_{total}}{t_{total}} \\). Understanding the distinction is essential in kinematics problems.",
            "example": "A car travels 50 m east in 5 s and then 30 m west in 3 s. Average speed = (50+30)/(5+3) = 10 m/s. Average velocity = (50-30)/(5+3) = 2.5 m/s east.",
