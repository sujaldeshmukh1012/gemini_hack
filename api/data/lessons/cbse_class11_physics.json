                            "introduction": "In the previous chapter, we discussed motion along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. While useful for trains on straight tracks or apples falling vertically, nature rarely adheres to straight lines. To describe the flight of a baseball, the orbit of a planet, or a car navigating a turn, we must extend our analysis to two dimensions.",

                                    "explanation": "One-dimensional motion restricts an object to two directions: positive or negative along a single axis (e.g., $+x$ or $-x$). However, an object moving in a plane requires two coordinates, usually $x$ and $y$, to specify its position at any given time $t$.",

Therefore, physical quantities like displacement, velocity, and acceleration must be treated as vectors—quantities that possess both magnitude and direction.",

While no real body is perfectly rigid (as all deform slightly under force), solids like steel or stone are good approximations. In a rigid body, if we consider particles at positions \\(\\vec{r}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{r}_2\\), the magnitude \\(|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|\\) is constant.",
